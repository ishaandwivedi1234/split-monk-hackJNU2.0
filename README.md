# ğŸš€ Split Monk Application | Hack JNU 2.0 ğŸš€

ğŸ¤” OBSERVATION ğŸ¤”

> We being a college students, organize may events and parties,
> either to give birthday surprise to our friends 	or to celebreate
> Teachers Day or any such event,  	But what we observed that whenever there is any such event 	which requires group funding, It becomes headace to 	split the amount and ask everyone to pay. which many times ends up in unequal contribution.

âœ¨PROBLEM STATEMENT âœ¨

> According to our observations it becomes very difficult to  	manage
> bills among our friends  	and peers,as there is no such market ready
> solution that  	works with indian payement options. We can ask 	our
> friends to pay us through GPay or Paytm or other  	such applications
> in order to distribute bill amount 	equally, but that dosen't solves
> the problem. It is not 	practically possible for civilized people to
> take their  	calculators out and start splitting the bills and ask for
> 	others to pay.  	 	Therefore, It is need of hour that there is some
> solution  	that can manage all the headace of asking or calculating
> 	amount that each individual can pay so that bill is  	splitted . 	
> 	But, just splitting is not important, there must be some 	easy means
> to transfer the amount aswell and what can 	be better than Unified
> Payment Interface !  	 	If We integrate UPI support in our application
> that 	that allows users to pay their contribution and balance 	the
> amounts between a group, then the solution becomes  	usable to all
> user holding bank account .
